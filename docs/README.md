Welcome to this webpage! We want to teach you everything we can about making mods with a texture pack. It is not the easiest thing to learn, but with practice can be mastered! This will be an in-depth tutorial on how everything works: animations, custom models, entity files, render controllers, and everything else you will need to learn. We will also have links to queries and common variables that you will use often while coding.
